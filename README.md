My current project is to set up a basic recipe website and demonstrate the knowledge I have gained in following The Odin Project's lessons to date.
I will be using a number of git commands in this project - and I see that I may have to make a few more notes on these than what I've done already.
Above all, what I need to do to remember what I've learnt is to practice.
